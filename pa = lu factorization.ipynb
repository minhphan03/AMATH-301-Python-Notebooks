        "# Week 3 Coding Lecture 2:  LU Factorization\n",
        "We have two different methods of solving systems of equations: Forward/back substitution and Gaussian elimination.  We just saw that, at least for large systems, forward/back substitution is vastly faster than Gaussian elimination.  We would therefore prefer to use forward/back substitution for all of our problems.  Unfortunately, forward/back substitution only work in special cases.  If our system isn't lower/upper triangular, then we can't use this faster method.  We have already seen several examples of non-triangular systems, so we know that we can't hope that all systems will be triangular in general.  However, it is possible that we could write all systems in some simple form so that we didn't have to use the full Gaussian elimination method.  In particular, suppose that we could always rewrite a system $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$ in the form\n",
        "\n",
        "$LU\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, \n",
        "\n",
        "where $L$ is an $N\\times N$ lower triangular matrix and $U$ is an $N\\times N$ upper triangular matrix.  If this were true, it would be relatively easy to solve the system.  To see how, note that $U\\mathbf{x}$ is an (unknown) $N\\times 1$ vector (because it is the product of an $N\\times N$ matrix $U$ and an $N\\times 1$ vector $\\mathbf{x}$).  If we give this vector a new name $\\mathbf{y}$, then we have \n",

        "Notice that the equation $L\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{b}$ is easy to solve!  $L$ is a lower triangular matrix and $\\mathbf{b}$ is a known vector, so we can just use forward substitution, which takes $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ flops.  Once we do this, we know the vector $\\mathbf{y}$, which means that we can also solve $U\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{y}$.  Again, this is easy to solve!  Since $U$ is upper triangular, we can just use back substitution, which also takes $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ flops.  We can therefore solve the original system in two $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ steps.  Since big-oh notation ignores constant multiples, this is essentially the same as $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$.  This means that if we are given a system in the form $LU\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, we can just use substitution twice instead of Gaussian elimination and therefore solve our system much faster.  \n",

        "Of course, it is unlikely that someone will simply hand you a system in this convenient form, so we need to find a method that calculates $L$ and $U$ from $A$.  Through a somewhat lucky coincidence, it turns out that (almost) every matrix $A$ can be written in this way, and that we can find $L$ and $U$ through Gaussian elimination.  We will go through an example by hand and then turn to python.  \n",
