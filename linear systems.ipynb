Calculating the condition number perfectly is not always possible, so `cond` only gives an approximation.  In particular, it might not give actual infinity even if the system does not have a solution.  If $A$ has a very large condition number then you should assume that there is no unique solution.

        "2) The scipy.linalg package has a function called `det` that calculates the *determinant* of a matrix.  If you ever take a more theoretical linear algebra class, you will spend a lot of time discussing the determinant, so it might come as a surprise to find that we will barely mention it in this class.  It turns out that the determinant is very useful theoretically, but very inefficient to calculate.  It does have the following useful property: A square system (that is, when you have the same number of equations as variables) has exactly one solution if and only if the determinant of $A$ is non-zero.  Unfortunately, the determinant is not defined for non-square matrices.  For example, "

        "When using python to solve systems of equations, you don't usually need to check the condition number or determinant (because `solve` will do so for you), but many other languages do not have this feature.  In particular, if you use MATLAB to solve systems of equations, you should always check the condition number of $A$ beforehand.  If the condition number is too large, then the correct answer is not to go ahead with one of the system solvers; the correct answer is to say \"no.\""
